PS1 get id command (ASCII "S")

Don't run it if you have already run other commands in the last 5/10 minutes.
Maybe can be a good idea remove your PS3mca unplug the USB, wait several minutes and replug it, then run this command.



PS1 write command (ASCII "W")

First of all this command actally need a "write.mcd" file, if there isn't you obtain a segmentation fault.
If you have a pure (raw) image of memory card (*.psm, *.ps, *.ddf, *.mcr, *.mc...) rename it to "write.mcd".
This command rewrite all memory card, reducing his life (limited write cycles).
As far as I could detect images of pcsx-r give problems on PS2 (my PSone is dead, I can play my PS1 games only on PS2 or on pcsx-r).
Maybe can be a good idea wait several minutes if you have already run other commands.



Why isn't in roadmap to support PS2 memorycard (SCPH-10020)?

First because my PS2 is alive.
Second because PS2 authentication isn't good documented.
Third because exist already other libusb driver to read and write it (see README.md).



Why isn't in roadmap to support PocketStation memorycard (SCPH-4000) properly?

I tried for at least a year, I bought several pockestations used to test.
I came to the conclusion that the ps3mca protocol does not support specific PocketStation commands.
Therefore, support for the PocketStation is impossible due to hardware limitations.
I have removed the PocketStation early support since 06 gen 2018.
