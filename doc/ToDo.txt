ToDo list:

- Correct reading support (errors in checksum);

- Correct writing support (errors in the odd frame);

- Complete pocketstation support (maybe impossible, since the ps3mca adapter seems to accept ONLY "r","w" and "s" command);

- Add clock support;

- Split monolitic source;

- Make possible read and write a particular frame value or a group (for example only 1 block);

- Make possible write only changed frame for improve lifetime of memorycard;

- Understand why there is the problem if send cmd in sequence;

- Test under other libusb O.S. (Windows, MacOSX, Android, OpenBSD/NetBSD, Haiku);

- add the source directly on pcsx-r project?
